      "Lord Shiva, in Hinduism, is regarded as a ‘Supreme’ deity! As per religious textbook, Shiva Mahapuran, once Lord Brahma and Vishnu went to war in to prove their supremacy over the one other. To sort this issue, Shiva formed a huge pillar of light asked the two to find the end of the light. Brahma chose to go upwards in the direction of light and Vishnu chose to go down. Much later, both appeared in front of Shiva and Vishnu accepted his defeat but Brahma chose to lie and said he found the end of light. This angered Shiva and he cursed Brahma that no one will ever pray to him ever. This pillar, later came to be known as Jyotirlinga.It is said that there are 64 Jyotirlingas but 12 of these are of utmost importance.",

      "The Shakti Pithas, also known as shaktipeethas, hold significant importance as sacred shrines and revered pilgrimage destinations dedicated to worshipping of Goddess Durga in various forms of Adi Shakti. The number of these shrines varies according to different Puranas, with mentions of 51, 52, 64, and 108 Shakti Pithas, among which 18 are identified as Astadasha Maha (major) in mediaeval Hindu texts." +
      "Numerous legends offer explanations for the origin of the Shakti Peethas, with the most popular being associated with the story of the Goddess Sati's demise. Overwhelmed with grief, Lord Shiva wandered the universe with Sati's body, reminiscing about their time together. To relieve him from this immense task, Lord Vishnu used his Sudarshana Chakra to divide Sati's body into 18 parts, each of which fell on the earth, sanctifying these locations as places of worship for people.",
